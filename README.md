# About Time For Rust

Yes, it is a timer library with a cute name. This meets specific timer needs I
typically have in writing Rust applications. It is possible others may have
similar needs.

## Distributions

The primary means to distribute timeforrust is as a mozilla crate and the
latest release should be made available thru the mozilla crate site. A
stand-alone detached source tarball may also be produced from a repository
checkout.
